     <p>Left 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first person shooter that is set during a zombie apocalypse in the American South. Up to 4 players can play and control the 4 survivors; Nick, Coach, Rochelle, and Ellis. While you are trying to fight through hordes of infected to reach safety, you use a variety of different items. These items can include guns, melee weapons, bombs, molotovs, defibrulators, and numerous other first aid equipment. This game emphasizes intense action, strategic cooperation, and replayability thanks to its code that adjusts enemy spawns and weather, for a different experience every time. </p>

    <p> Above is gameplay of the final part of the Dark Carnival campaign, where you have to perform a concert in order to get the attention of helicopters nearby. You have to kill hordes of zombies while waiting for rescue, and then have to scramble to the helicopter in time so you dont get left behind. It is truly one of my favorite parts of this game, and I am very glad I found a video on it.</p>
