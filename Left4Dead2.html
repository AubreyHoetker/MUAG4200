     <p>Left 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first person shooter that is set during a zombie apocalypse in the American South. Up to 4 players can play and control the 4 survivors; Nick, Coach, Rochelle, and Ellis. While you are trying to fight through hordes of infected to reach safety, you use a variety of different items. These items can include guns, melee weapons, bombs, molotovs, defibrulators, and numerous other first aid equipment. This game emphasizes intense action, strategic cooperation, and replayability thanks to its code that adjusts enemy spawns and weather, for a different experience every time. </p>
